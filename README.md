# Curricular Connections Guide

This project was my senior capstone project. The goal of this program was to automate the connecting of NC State courses to programs hosted by Arts NC State through the use of themes derived from course/program descriptions. These connections can then allow Arts NC State to reach out to professors regarding courses related to courses that they teach. The site also includes a page that allows any NC State affiliate to look up Arts NC State programs based on many different filters.
